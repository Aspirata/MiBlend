# Mcblend
A useful tool for creating minecraft content in blender

## Mcblend is in the alpha state, so expect bugs and changes during development

This is an experimental branch. I'm testing new features here

To Install this brach as addon you need to download bab (https://github.com/Moo-Ack-Productions/bpy-build) and run bab in cmd in Mcblend Folder or you can pack Mcblend Source folder to .zip file and install it as addon

> [!NOTE]
> There aren't many functions in Mcblend right now (Below you can see the list of features that are already available and planned)

| Feature | Stage | Current State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Upgrade Materials | Done | Upgrade materials function is fully working |
| Procedural PBR | WIP | It works, but I'm still adding new setting and features |
| Create Sky | Done | This feature creates sky and clouds |
| Fix Materials & Fix World | Done | It works |
| Swap Texture Pack | Not Started | Well, It's not started yet ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Assets | Done | It works, but there is only SRE in built-in assets |
